# Python UDP Video Streaming

This is a simple python project to allow video streaming through UDP.

## Usage
Run the `sender.py` program on the server machine, and the `receiver.py` on the client (they can be the same computer, and *must* be in the same network). You can tweak the compression level and the encryption password on the first lines of `sender.py` and `receiver.py`.
